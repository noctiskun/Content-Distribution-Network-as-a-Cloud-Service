Designed a VPC for Content Distribution Network using Distributed group of servers, wrote a yml script in ansible to orchestrate Virtual private cloud creation and containerized the solution with self-healing feature inspired by Kubernetes, implemented data hierarchy for CDN and data replication based on the need in the edge delivery node, which was orchestrated by the control node and used a load balancer for the same, verified the network system created, with network traffic testing by sending more than the specified content request limit on a Linux based edge
server to verify the behavior of data replication.
